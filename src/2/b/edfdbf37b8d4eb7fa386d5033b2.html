					Hi Tammy,
					</p>
					<p>
					I am in Fort Worth, TX. Where are you? Note that my new email address is lobdillj@att.net.
					</p>
					<p>
					I would very much like to help you all I can. I am copying this to George Dobbs, who currently is the keeper of our Dobbs family history.  George is the son of Dan Dobbs, son of G. Byron Dobbs, son of Arna M. Dobbs, brother of Arthur F. Dobbs, who was your father, Leon's grandfather, thus, your great grandfather (if I've calculated correctly).
					</p>
					<p>
					I believe your Dad's father and, for sure, his grandfather are buried in Albany TX.
					</p>
					<p>
					I would like to keep in touch with you as you work on this genealogy. Please keep me up on what you find.
					</p>
					<p>
					I'll see what else I can find from my trip to Albany in 2004.
					</p>
					<p>
					Best regards,
					</p>
					<p>
					Jerry Lobdill

					I hope this finds you doing well. I am writing to ask for your assistance. I am currently triing to find my roots. I am Leons youngest child, His parents were both passed before I was born, I have very little knowledge of where I  came from or who my relatives are on his side. If you have any information you could share I would greatly appreciate it.<br />
					Thank You<br />

					&gt; I was sorry to hear tonight of your father's passing yesterday(?) at<br />
					&gt; Ingleside. I found my letter to him in my files. I have a booklet,<br />
					&gt; about 16 pages) long, that I wrote about my grandparents' homestead<br />
					&gt; days near Fort Sumner, NM that I may have sent your father after I<br />
					&gt; sent him my initial letter on Sept 12, 2004. Did you find such a<br />
					&gt; booklet in his things? It had an oval picture on the front. If you<br />
					&gt; didn't get it I'd be happy to send you a copy. Just send me your<br />
					&gt; mailing address.<br />
					&gt;<br />
					&gt; I now recall one of the stories Leon told me about Uncle Ott (Arthur<br />
					&gt; Dobbs). It was about a dog he had that died and Uncle Ott built a<br />
					&gt; coffin and took the dog and buried it down by a river at Albany. Ott<br />
					&gt; was Leon's grandfather. Leon said Ott had tears running down his face<br />
					&gt; as he buried the dog. I wish Leon had written down his stories and<br />
					&gt; passed them to me. They were great.<br />
					&gt;<br />
					&gt; Best,<br />
					&gt;<br />
					&gt; Jerry Lobdill<br />
					&gt; Leon's 2nd cousin<br />
					&gt;<br />
