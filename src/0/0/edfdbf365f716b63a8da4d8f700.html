				<h4>Narrative</h4>

						Jacob Burruss, Sr.<br />
						Jacob Burruss, Sr. was born in New Kent County, Virginia, which later became King William County, Virginia.    On December 20, 1703, after the death of John Burruss, his father, Thomas Burruss deeded 100 + acres in King William County to Jacob Burruss, (1) .  Thomas also deeded additional acreage to Jacob Burruss,  on March 20, 1705 (2). Thomas Burruss, was almost certainly Jacob's older brother. Unfortunately we do not know the name of their mother.  His wife's name was Mary.  Some researchers have speculated she may have been Mary Bibb but I have been unable to substantiate or refute this. In Jacob's Will, he identified her only as "my dearly beloved, wife Mary."<br />
					Because Jacob Sr.'s  name did not appear in either the King William or King and Queen County Quit Claim Rolls of 1704, it has been assumed he was not of age at that time. Therefore, he was most likely born between 1680 and 1685.<br />
						By March 25, 1725, Jacob Sr.  had moved to the western portion of King William County, where he patented 400 acres. The acreage was described as being adjacent to the land of John Hawkins and Ranger's Path.(3) When Augustine Moore patented 6950 acres of land in 1726, it was described as being on the north side of the North Anna River, and on the north side of the north fork of Polecat Swamp, adjacent to the lands of Jacob Burruss. From these deeds the location of his plantation can be determined. Today it would be south of Cedar Fork Road (601) and east of Route 1. Originally in King William County, it became part of Caroline County in 1727. It was here, in the St. Margaret's Parish of Caroline County, that he raised his family and later generations of his descendants lived.<br />
					Jacob Burruss, Sr. was a well-respected member of this newly formed County. He served as a  juror, and the Caroline County Order Books show he provided the security to post bonds for several of his Caroline County neighbors. He obviously was a man of financial means, as was his brother Charles, who sometimes posted large bonds with Jacob.   Land owners took turns maintaining and constructing the roads adjacent to their property. Jacob Sr.,  first appeared as a Supervisor of Roads in 1733, the first year such duties were recorded. (4)<br />
					On March 15, 1735, Jacob Burruss patented 400 acres of land in Hanover County, Virginia for 40 shillings. (5)  This land was described as lying on both sides of Hickory Creek, adjacent to the land of George Brock, Colonel Symes and John Aylett.<br />
					Exactly how much land Jacob  owned cannot be determined, but from existing records we know at one time, he owned property in,  at least three counties. His neighbors included some of the most prominent families in Caroline County, including the Carr and  Minor families,, as well as, the Terrells, Hawkins, Hacketts, Moores, and others. His home place was close to Golansville, an area with a large concentration of Quaker families.<br />
					Without a doubt, Jacob Burruss was a respected plantation owner and leader in his community. This is evidenced by the fact that he appraised the estates of his neighbors, and served as a witness to the wills of some of the most prominent families in Caroline County such as the 1738 Will of Thomas Carr. (6) Thomas Carr was the grandfather of Dabney Carr who married Thomas Jefferson's sister Martha. Thomas Carr's great-grandson, Stanwyx Hord married Justinana Burruss, the granddaughter of Jacob Burruss.<br />
					Jacob Burruss like most of the larger land owners, owned slaves. Tobacco was a major crop, grown in Caroline, but was also a labor intensive crop. (7) The records show Jacob as an active community leader. The County Court House, near Kidd's Fork, was some distance from his home place. Only gentlemen, of some financial security and leisure, and aided by slave labor, could afford the luxury of community involvement.<br />
						On March 20, 1742, Jacob Burruss wrote his last will and testament. He signed his Will himself and his wife Mary witnessed the will with her Mark. (8)<br />
						In the Name of God, Amen, 20th day of March Anno Donne 1742, I Jacob Burruss of the parish of Saint Margaret's County of Caroline, being well in body and of perfect memory, honorable to Almighty God for it, and calling to memborie the uncertainty of this life and that all Flesh must yield to Death, when it shall please God to Call, do make and Declare this my last will and testament in manner and  form following. First being penitent and sorry for all my sines most humbly deserving forgiveness for the same, I commend my soul to Almighty God my Savior and Redemer for whom by whose mortal death, I believe assoundly to be saved. I have full redemption and forgiveness for all my sins and do entrust to the Kingdom of Heaven and my Body I sommit to the Earth, to be desently buried at the Desire of my Executor hereafter named and for the setling of my Temporal Estate...................<br />
						Complete Will can be viewed on my homepage for Burruss Wills<br />
						Jacob left his "Dearly beloved wife Mary, one third of all my whole, real and Personel with the Plantation whereon I now live in Caroline County during her natural life and after her Decease to my son Charles &amp; his heirs." Jacob mentioned his sons, William, Jacob, Charles, Thomas, and Henry. He bequeathed furniture, feather beds, cows, yearlings, and ewes. His son Charles was to receive an iron pot, pewter dishes and plates. He left his son William a legacy of 25 pounds. For his daughter Elizabeth, he left a feather bed, furniture, a cow and a yearling and two ewes. His other three daughters, Ann, Mary, and Justiana were left the balance of the estate. Most likely the children were treated equally in this final bequest. Some had previously received land, household items, and livestock and did not receive additional bequests in the Will. Charles received the plantation home place and his son Thomas, received the 273 acres on Hickory Creek in Hanover County. It was his son Jacob Burruss who lived on the home place, and why Charles did not take possession is unclear. The family home must have been rather large, considering the number of beds, household goods, and livestock the children received. Because William was named executor of the estate, it appears he may have been the eldest son, and Charles likely the youngest. From bible records we know that son Jacob Burruss, Jr. was born in 1714 but the birth order of the other children is not known.

						On February 13, 1755, Richard Harris presented and proved the Last Will and Testament of Jacob Sr.. An inventory of his estate was returned to the Caroline Court on February 15, 1755, and on a motion, Robert Fleming Bibb was ordered to annex his estate. (9)<br />
						With his death, Caroline County lost one its first pioneers. Many generations of Jacob's descendants made Caroline County and Virginia their home.  My story continues through Jacob Burruss, Jr, son of Jacob Burruss.  If you would like additional information about other children of Jacob Burruss, Sr., please email me for the file.
